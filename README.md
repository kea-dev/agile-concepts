# Exercise 1

### Create a GitHub Project for your group


<img width="100" align="right" alt="image" src="[https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/155492/219313640-1328aefb-7695-41d2-bbef-5c5ffe6ab079.png](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/155492/219378934-dfd3a9df-311a-42f7-bd11-b0289efa8fad.png)">

On GitHub create a new project to use for your group - _(Projects >> Flip Button from "Link Project" to "New Projects"  >> Create new file)_ Name your project so it reflects the assignment you were given.



Add two lines to the file:

1. First line is your name (First + Last) preceded with a hash (`#`) and separated with a space.
1. Second line is your GitHub handle preceded with two hashes (`##`) and also separated with a space.

<details><summary>My file <code>lakruzz.md</code> would look like this:</summary>

```markdown
# Lars Kruse
## lakruzz
```
---
</details>

Add and Commit the file!

_Notice that when you hover-over the code a copy icon appears in the top-right corner - just click it to copy it to the the clip board._

```markdown
Go back into your file `<handle>.md` and add some `MarkDown`. It shall include:

- [x] A level 1 header with your full name.
- [x] A level 2 header with your GitHub handle.
- [ ] An image (of yourself - preferably).
- [ ] A bulleted list of things you are currently working on.
- [ ] A prioritized list of Programming languages and technologies you wanna work with.
- [ ] A link to all your public repositories on GitHub.
- [ ] Your GMail (assuming you have one).
- [ ] A short description of what you dream of working with - a couple of years from now - when you graduate and enter the labour market as a full-fledged, full-time IT Architect.

Also make sure:

- [ ] Assign this issue to yourself
- [ ] Commit the file when you are done
- [ ] As you progress with the items on the list - come back to this issue and check out the items.
- [ ] When you are completely done (_done done_) - close the issue.

```

With the Code snippet above in your clip board go and create a new issue in this repository

- `Title`: **"&lt;Your name&gt;'s file"**
- `Content`: Dump the content of the clipboard (the code above)
- `Assign`: Assign the issue to yourself.
- `Submit`: Save the issue

TEST by visiting  [github.com/issues/assigned](https://github.com/issues/assigned) - do you see your new issue? If not: _did you assign it to yourself?_
